# woocommerce-membership-by-role
Lets you define a "magic" mambership product in woo (by id), then when this product is bought, after checkout it assigns a premium_member role to that user. Use that along with restrict_content or my guestshortcode plugins to restrict content and build a membership site. 

- Admin bit with the magic product id/s isn't implemented yet. it's currently hardcoded in there somewhere still (line 138 or search on "SET THE PRODUCT IDS")
